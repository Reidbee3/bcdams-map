DCMI usage comment: "The described resource may be derived from the related resource in whole or in part. Recommended best practice is to identify the related resource by means of a string conforming to a formal identification system."

Every object in the BCDAMS will have two preservation ARK identifiers: one for the preservation master AIP and one for the access copy AIP.
