### Access Guidelines

Preferably this title comes from the item itself or uses some text that appears on the item. Write out the title or text from the item as it appears on the item.

Identical titles may be used for different items when appropriate.

__Capitalization:__

 - Capitalize the first word and proper nouns
 - Keep other capitalization the same as it is found on the item
 - If the title is taken from a catalog, copy the capitalization from the record

__Letter:__ Letter from [sender] to [recipient], [YYYY Month DD]

__Newsletter:__ [title of newsletter], [issue date]

__Book:__ Title from the catalog record

__Other formats:__ Devise a brief descriptive title that uniquely identifies the resource (e.g. names of persons, corporate bodies, objects, activities, and events). If possible, use title or text from the item as it appears on the item.
